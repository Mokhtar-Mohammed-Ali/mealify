# Mealify Website

A simple personal portfolio website built using **HTML** and **CSS (Flexbox)** only.  
This project is part of my ongoing Full Stack training at Rout Academy, and it focuses on modern layout techniques.

## ðŸŽ¯ What I learned:

â€™ve just completed Task 4 of Week 5 in Route Academy training, using CSS Variables and Flexbox.

ðŸ”¹ We used Flexbox to build smooth, responsive layouts with full control over spacing, direction, and alignment â€“ both vertically and horizontally.

One of the smartest tricks we applied in this task:
âœ… Creating a Dark Mode and Light Mode toggle using only CSS â€“
No JavaScript, no events â€“ just by linking styles to the checkbox state and using :checked with CSS variables to switch themes dynamically.

The whole project is built with just HTML and CSS, showing how much can be achieved with the right techniques and creativity.



## ðŸ’¡ Tools used:

- HTML5
- CSS3 (Flexbox)
